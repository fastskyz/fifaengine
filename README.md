# fifaengine
A basic FIFA 18 autobuyer based on oczkers fut-api.

The tool is no longer working or up-to-date!
Do not use it or it's code without heavy modification!


Verion 0.9 uploaded and almost working!
Few changes to do to get to v1.0!

The .ui file contains the code for the GUI of the app.
To convert the .ui to .py use the .bat file. ( pyuic5 must be installed )

To make the .py a .exe file you have to have pyisntaller installed.

I need accounts to test this script/program on to make sure it's stable!
Please contact me if you would like to help!
